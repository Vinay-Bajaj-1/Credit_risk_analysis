**Aim** 

To develop a machine learning model to analyze Lending Club loan data, identifying patterns and creating a predictive model for _approved loans only_ which will help the company to better understand their customer status whether they will be able to repay the loan or not.


**About Company** 

LendingClub is a financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to offer loan trading on a secondary market.

**Steps** 
1. Problem Statement
2. Data Understanding
3. Explorately Data Analysis
4. Modelling
5. Model Comparisons

**Model outputs**
NN :             [train : 70.06%, test : 71.14]
XGBoost :        [train :79.01% , test : 81%]
Random Forest :  [train : 78.5%, test : 80.27%]

**Result**
After modelling we found out that XG Boost performed better than other models with 81% accuracy on test data.
